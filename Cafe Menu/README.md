# Cafe Menu
This is a sample cafe menu created using HTML and CSS. It displays a list of coffee and dessert items, along with their prices.

## How to Use
To view the cafe menu, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Styling
The page has a background image of coffee beans, and the font family used throughout the page is sans-serif. The main heading (h1) has a font size of 40px, and its margin top is set to 0 to remove any default spacing.

The menu is contained within a div with a class of "menu". The div has a width of 80%, a background color of burlywood, and is centered on the page using margin-left and margin-right set to auto. The maximum width of the div is 500px.

The coffee and dessert sections are each contained within a section element. The items are displayed using an article element with a class of "item". The item names and prices are displayed using p elements with classes of "flavor" and "price", respectively. The text aligns left for the item names and right for the prices.

## Footer
The footer includes a link to the cafe's website and displays the cafe's address. The links are styled to change color when hovered over or clicked.

## Credits
This project is based on a challenge from the freeCodeCamp CSS course.
